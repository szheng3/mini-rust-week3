# Individual Project #1: Rust API Microservice
Build a useful API server in the domain of data engineering or machine learning engineering.

## Week 1 Progress

This week, I familiarized myself with the basics of Rust and gained hands-on experience by using the Rust Project Template (from https://github.com/nogibjj/rust-new-project-template). My first Rust project was building an API server, which provided a great opportunity for practical application of my newfound knowledge.

## Week 2 Progress

This week, I set up a GitHub CICD action pipeline for building, linking, and testing. Additionally, I utilized a Dockerfile to package my Rust services. Furthermore, I deployed the service on Google Cloud Platform using Kubernetes. You can access a demo of the setup at https://apiv2.sszzz.me.
### Usage
> Run `make run` in the terminal, it will launch a server.

> Run `curl -v http://localhost:8000/api/health` to get the JSON response.
